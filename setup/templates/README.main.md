# Coding Interview Challenges

Welcome! This workspace contains **5 independent challenges** in separate folders.
Each folder is its own git repository with its own history.

Open the terminal and `cd` into a challenge folder to begin.

## Challenges

| # | Folder | Topic | Difficulty |
|---|--------|-------|------------|
| 1 | `01-git-recovery/` | Recover deleted code from git history | Medium |
| 2 | `02-merge-conflicts/` | Resolve semantic merge conflicts | Medium |
| 3 | `03-type-lint-fix/` | Fix TypeScript & ESLint errors | Medium |
| 4 | `04-docker-optimization/` | Optimize a Dockerfile for faster builds | Medium |
| 5 | `05-algorithm/` | Implement an LRU Cache (O(1) operations) | Hard |

Each challenge has its own `README.md` with detailed instructions.

## Tips

- Use `git log`, `git diff`, `git status` freely — each folder is its own repo.
- Run `npm test` in challenge folders to verify your solutions.
- There is no hidden trick — the READMEs tell you everything you need to know.

Good luck!
